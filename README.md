Implementing an ATM interface with access to a bank database containing 3 tables.\
Upon startup of application, users will be prompted to either login, signup, or exit the application.\
If signing up, the user will be prompted for a username and password. The username must be unique\
and the application will communicate with the database to ensure each user has a unique username.\
The user must also confirm the password to ensure the user correctly enters their desired password.\
After signing up, the user has the chance to login or exit the app. If the login option is selected,\
the application prompts the user for the username and password. If the username and password don't\
match an account in the records, the app returns to the initial menu prompting the user to either\
login, signup, or exit the app. If the username and password match an account in the records, the\
app continues to the main account menu, where the user is prompted to select either to deposit\
money, withdraw money, view the account balance, delete the account, or exit out of the application.
